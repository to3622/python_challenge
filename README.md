# python_challenge
This open source code contains two projects. A brief description of each follows.

Project #1 PyBank is an analysis for financial records containing monthly revenue reported by day, month and year.
The analysis detials the maximum monthly profits, minimum monthly profits, the average monthly change, and total number of months covered by the analysis.

Project #2 PyPoll is an analysis of elections. The analysis identifies total votes cast, votes won per candidate, % votes won per candidate, and highlights the winning candidate by popular vote.

Both project analysis was performed by writing script in python 3.8.  The code illustrates use of lists and dictionaries to parse the data to glean insigts.

I hope you enjoy perusing the code and please provide feedback.

Cheers,

New Coder
